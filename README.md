# baseforge-lr-pipeline

The project implements and compares Simple Linear Regression, Multiple
Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso
Regression using Python and Scikit-learn.

Objective:
Perform end-to-end regression analysis including EDA, model building,
evaluation, and comparison.

Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:
insurance.csv
Features: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region
Target: charges

Workflow:
EDA
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge and Lasso
Model Evaluation and Diagnostics

Metrics:
MSE, RMSE, R2 Score

Conclusion:
Multiple Linear Regression provided better performance compared to
Simple Linear Regression. Regularization improved coefficient stability
and reduced overfitting risk.
